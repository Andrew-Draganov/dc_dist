class DBSCAN(object):
    '''
    This class implements the density based spatial clustering in applications with noise algorithm

    Arguments:
      eps: epsilon being used to identify the eps-neighborhood of a datapoint
      min_pts: minimal number of points s.t. a datapoint can be considered as a core object if the number
        of points in the eps-neighborhood exceeds min_pts
      dist_method: distance function being used to calculate the proximity of two datapoints
      cluster_type: 'standard' will apply the basic procedure for DBSCAN, set to 'corepoints' if the procedure
        shall just consider core points being labeled, i.e., borderpoints are not attached to a cluster

    Properties:
      eps: epsilon value for the eps-neighborhood
      min_pts: minimal number of points for identifying core objects
      dist_method: distance fnc
      labels: labels of the datapoints, i.e., the affiliation of the points to the clusters

        This method executes the DBSCAN algorithm on the attached
        dataset. First, it calculates the distances for each point
        within the dataset to each other point. By iterating the whole
        dataset, we can identify the affiliation for the points to
        clusters. If a core point is found, the point
        is used to expand the cluster, i.e., by calling the subrouting
        _expand_cluster(.), we can identfy each point being density
        reachable from a core point. If for an datapoint the conditions
        for a core point do not hold, we can regard this point as a
        Noise point (probably border point). After the cluster expansion,
        we take the next unlabeled point and continue in the same manner
        as described till every point is labeled.

        they are density-reachable from some other point within the cluster.
